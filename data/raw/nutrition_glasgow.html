When dietary fibres reach the colon, most are fully or partially fermented by commensal microbiota, releasing bioactive molecules. However, rapid fermentation of fibres may cause undesirable symptoms for some people due to the production of gas. Sources of fibre in our diet are becoming more varied as their use in food reformulation grows. The impact of consuming mixtures of different fibres on digestive symptoms is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro fermentation of fibres used in food reformulation (inulin, a short chain fructo-oligosaccharide and soluble corn fibre (SCF)) individually, and in combination using an in vitro colonic fermentation model (n=12 individuals). The pH of the control fermentation was significantly higher than all fibre conditions at 24h, and the SCF pH was higher than other fibres (p&lt;0.05). Although we were unable to detect differences in gas production (ml) or gas production rate (ml/hr) due to inter-individual variability, final pH did differ between the fibre conditions. Speed of gas production may be more important than total volume in relation to digestive symptoms. Total colonic gas volume is a result of both production of gas by the bacteria from fibre and conversion of gases into short chain fatty acids (e.g. CO2 into acetate). Differences in microbiota composition and metabolism is likely to explain the inter-individual variation. This variability means that we need larger numbers of fermentations to compare fibres, but it is also important to fully understand the range of impacts fibres may have on digestive symptoms.

<p>
Background: Jamaica is part of the global pandemic of childhood obesity, which is highly predictive of adult obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). WHO (2018) reported that 41 million children under the age of five years were overweight or obese. Educational interventions are effective strategies to improve infant nutrition. 
Aim: To assess the impact of a nutrition-based educational intervention on the development of obesity in an existing cohort of children from 2 to 5 years of age.
Objectives: 1) Assess the impact of the intervention on anthropometry, body composition, child feeding practices, parental feeding style, and blood pressure in a cohort of children from 2 to 5 years of age. 2) Evaluate blood markers of cardiometabolic risk at 5 years of age.
Methodology: Controlling for socioeconomic status, maternal characteristics, food insecurity, child’s birth anthropometry, sex, age of adiposity rebound, sleep and screen time and physical activity, mothers  in the original cohort were randomized to participate or not in face-to-face nutrition-based educational  sessions (nutrition in pregnancy, breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices) during pregnancy until 9 months post-partum. . Measurements of anthropometry and body composition of their offspring, as well as their feeding practices will be assessed annually. Blood glucose, insulin, hs-CRP, leptin/ghrelin ratio, IGF-1, and lipids will be measured at age 5 years. All measurements will be compared between the intervention and control groups. 
Significance of research: To prevent obesity in children and the development of NCDs as they age.

Background: There is concern about plant-based protein quality in terms of digestibility and bioavailability of the indispensable amino acids (IAAs). A recently developed minimally invasive dual stable isotope tracer (DSIT) gives a more reliable measure of protein digestibility at the level of the ileum compared to the usual oro-faecal method which is confounded by endogenous protein sources. 
Objectives: We aimed to measure IAAS digestibility (except tryptophan) and derive digestibility IAAs scores (DIAAS) of the red kidney bean (RKB), Phaseolus vulgaris, consumed in a typical Jamaican meal using the DSIT method.  
Methods: RKB with IAAs intrinsically labelled with deuterium, using deuterium oxide, was used to make a meal (stewed beans and rice), to which uniformly labelled [13C]-spirulina was added as reference protein. This was fed to 10 healthy young adults as primed/intermittent doses and blood samples collected. Using the IAAs isotopic enrichments (ppm excess) at steady state, measured by mass spectrometry, each IAA digestibility was determined as the ratio of plasma to meal 2H-IAA divided by ratio of plasma to meal 13C-IAA, adjusted for [13C]-spirulina digestibility and a transamination factor. DIAAS were calculated in reference to requirement patterns for adults. 
Results: IAAs digestibility (mean±SD, %) of RKB protein was 79.4±0.5. DIAAS (%) were greater than 75, except methionine scoring 38. 
Conclusion: RKB protein is a good source of the IAAs (DIAAS &gt; 75) in young healthy adults, except for methionine, the limiting IAA, indicating the importance of complementing RKB protein with cereal-grains in plant-based diets to supply adequate sulphur amino acids.

Low energy availability (LEA) has been reported in elite male Olympic athletes, but the impacts of LEA on performance is unclear.  The aim of the investigation was to explore the association of surrogate markers of LEA on countermovement jump (CMJ) and cognitive performance in elite male volleyball players.  We hypothesized that players with surrogate markers of LEA will demonstrate poorer jumping and cognitive performance.  Using a cross-sectional design, 22 male athletes from a national indoor volleyball program were assessed during the critical period of the in-season for indicators of LEA, including resting metabolic rate (RMR) testing, DXA assessment of bone mineral density and body composition, hematological analysis, 4-day dietary intake assessment, restrained eating behaviour via three-factor eating questionnaire–R18, which were compared with knee health via the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment—patellar tendon questionnaire, performance via CMJ and cognitive functioning via Stroop testing protocols.  The main finding in this investigation was players with surrogate markers of LEA (55%) demonstrated poorer jump performance (mean power, peak velocity &amp; jump height p≤0.05), and a trending decrease in reaction time and lower cognitive inhibition (mean effect size after practice: 0.42 and 0.43, respectively).   The findings suggest that elite male indoor volleyball players are at risk of impaired performance associated with LEA.  Future work should explore methods to better identify larger athletes in LEA.

For Ghanaian women of reproductive age (WRA), anemia remains a pressing issue, currently affecting 35% of this population. In Ghana, anemia is mostly associated with iron deficiency and, if left untreated, could result in several adverse outcomes including severe fatigue and exhaustion resulting in decreased work productivity, neurocognitive impairment, and complications with chronic kidney disease. Though increasing the consumption of animal source foods is recommended to curtail iron-deficiency anemia, this strategy neither cost-effective nor environmentally friendly. 
As an alternative approach, palm weevil larvae could be leveraged to improve WRA’s iron status through direct consumption and sale of the larvae. The objective of this study was to identify the facilitators and barriers to the consumption and access to palm weevil larvae in Kumasi, Ghana.
Mind mapping and focus group discussions were conducted in five peri-urban communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana. In addition, a semi-structured survey and key-informant in-depth interviews were administered among sellers and customers of palm weevil larvae in Kumasi. Thematic analysis was used to examine the facilitators and barriers to palm weevil larvae consumption and access as well as WRA’s general knowledge of nutrition and anemia. Cross-tabulations and chi-square analyses were completed for the quantitative variables to identify significant associations. 
Women generally had favorable perceptions of palm weevil larvae as a nutritious food in its raw, frozen, and processed forms, and were eager to be involved in its value chain. The factors positively influencing the acceptance of palm weevil larvae were its perceived nutritional and health benefits, and its taste. The main barriers to its consumption and access were its scarcity, inconsistency, price and shelf-stability, the fear of its unauthenticity and unsafety, unawareness of its purchasing locations and misinformation about its benefits. 
Palm weevil larvae’s challenging access combined with women’s clear interest in palm weevil larvae women’ support the need for a community-based domestication of palm weevil larvae. Future studies should examine the feasibility and logistical requirements of such a strategy and its impact on increasing the consumption and access to palm weevil larvae.

Purpose of the study: The aim of this study was to evaluate the overall preparedness level of schools for managing pupils with food allergies across West of Scotland.
Methods: The ‘School Anaphylaxis Preparedness survey’ was distributed to school principals between Jan- Jun 2020. The objective and subjective preparedness levels were described by analysing responses to certain survey items; school’s adherence to National/ European guidelines and the respondent’s perception of school preparedness. Based on the results, a scoring system was developed to categorise schools by preparedness status; equipped &amp; ready, transitional, improvements required or unprepared.
Main findings: 155 schools returned the survey, of which 72% (n=112) had pupils with a prescribed adrenaline autoinjector (AAI). Just 16% of schools had a food allergy management policy (n=25) and 62% did not have allergen labelling in the canteen (n=96). Of schools storing AAIs, less than half were accessible (n=54, 47%) and just 27% (n=44) had personalised allergy action plans in place. Previous experience managing anaphylaxis was associated with policy implementation (p=0.009). In general, schools rated their perceived preparedness highly, yet just 6% of schools (n=10) were categorized as ‘equipped and ready’ (score &gt;75%) and the mean score was just 50%. Schools supported a need for a standardised national policy and further training (n=151, 93%).
Principal conclusions: The results demonstrate inconsistencies in the management of pupils with allergies across the region, where experience seems to promote preparedness, rather than current legislation. This survey highlights areas for improvement to ensure schools receive suitable support.
